His current dissertation research aims to develop advanced statistical learning methods to integrate high dimensional data, such as multi-omics datasets, and extract disease-relevant features in thousands of heterogeneous biological elements and predict disease status in a unified supervised multi-omics framework. He has also been joining the Tulane Center for Biomedical Informatics and Genomics and working in the broad fields of bioinformatics related to multi-omics integration, such as high dimensional genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, and metabolomics data."
